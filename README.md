# About this Project
- Here I used Vanilla JavaScript, a little bit of DOM, HTML CSS and JavaScipt for this project
- This Project sharpened my skills to work with Document Object Model

## What is DOM?
* DOM stands for Document Object Model - it provides a structured representation of the HTML or XML content of a web page.
* DOM allows JavaScript to interact with, and manipulate, the content, structure, and style of the web page.
  - Event Handling:
    * The DOM enables JavaScript to listen and respond to user events like clicks, keyboard input, or mouse movements.
    * This is crucial for creating interactive web pages where the content reacts to user actions.
